# Development
After sometime, I have finished the basic parts of the backend for WinsVideo 2.0. 

# Info
The code is written in Javascript. Node.js is the backend framework used with the express package

# Build
For devs who want to try the backend up
- Clone the repo
- Enter the "backend" directory
- Do 'npm install'
- And then do 'node .'
Done!
